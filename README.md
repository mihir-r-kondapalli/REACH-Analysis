# REACH-Analysis

This repository contains analysis code and statistical tools developed during a research project on **Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)** and their possible connection to **magnetars**, conducted through the **REACH** program at **CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics)**.

## Project Overview

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are short, high-energy pulses of radio waves originating from extragalactic sources. This research project focused on exploring the relationship between FRBs and magnetars, a type of highly magnetized neutron star, using data from leading observatories.

## Mentorship

This project was conducted under the guidance of PhD researchers and graduate students affiliated with CIERA. The mentorship provided deep insights into astrophysical phenomena, data pipelines, and modern research methodologies.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for all analysis.
- **Pandas**: Extensively used for efficient data manipulation and exploration.
- **NumPy, Matplotlib**: Supporting libraries for numerical analysis and visualization.
- **Statistical Methods**: Custom statistical tests were implemented to identify patterns and anomalies in FRB activity.
- **LISA and CHIME**: Real observational data was analyzed from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) observatories.

## Features

- Import and clean observational FRB datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify candidate magnetar signals
- Apply statistical models to test hypotheses about FRB generation mechanisms
- Generate visualizations for burst activity, energy distributions, and potential correlations

## Sample Results

Examples of insights drawn from the analysis include:
- Potential clustering of FRB events consistent with magnetar emission models
- Temporal trends and distributions revealing candidate FRB sources
- Comparative analysis of CHIME and LISA observational data
